Playing around with Next

This is the basic Portfolio page with custom forum, posts, auth system and so on.
All is writen on Next + React on Frontend, backend is actually using Node + Express

I'm think future is for Next and SSR, so I'd think it would be nite idea to practice with that and create something relatively big
